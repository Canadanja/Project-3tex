\section{Introduction}



In this report we will be using natural units:
\begin{align*}
\hbar = c = e = m_e = 1\\
\Rightarrow [E] = \mathrm{a.u.},
\end{align*}
where $\hbar$ is the Planck constants divided by $2\pi$, $c$ is the speed of light, $e$ is the elemantary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass. The unit of enegry than becomes atomic units, denoted as a.u.
